## How does this work?

Using serverless functions you can build all the HTTP you need to power your static site (finally!!!). This example site uses Netlify Lambda to send messages to all of your friends using Twilio.

## Setup

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/stefanjudis/8-bit-revolution)

To set this project up yourself you can hit the button (ðŸ‘†) which leads you to a one-click install solution. What you need is a Twilio account and number and the numbers of your friends.

You can watch me setting it up in real time! ðŸ™ˆ
